# GitHub Actions workflow for testing the Marimushka export action
# This workflow tests various aspects of the Marimushka export functionality:
# - Exporting only notebooks (no apps or notebooks_wasm)
# - Exporting with all inputs (notebooks, apps, notebooks_wasm)
# - Exporting with a custom template
# - Error handling with non-existent directories
